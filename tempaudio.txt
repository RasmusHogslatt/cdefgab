I am making a music program in rust. It parses musicxml to my own guitar tablature and renders it. It also has a time_scrubber that simulates the playback in time and sends the notes that should be played at a given time to the main function. In the main function, an audioplayer plays the notes so you can hear what the the song is meant to sound like using the karplus-strong algorithm.
